# Hi, I'm @MJH-devTW 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a developer and researcher with a deep passion for real-time systems, network programming, and data analysis, particularly in the finance sector. I specialize in C++, Python, and MetaTrader 5 (MT5), and am constantly exploring innovative ways to apply these technologies to complex problems, whether in game development or financial analysis.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

### 1. **Real-Time Network Simulation with C++**
   - I've been working on developing high-performance real-time simulation environments using C++. These simulations focus on network input/output, ensuring that data can be processed at low latencies and high frequencies for tasks like financial trading systems and real-time multiplayer game environments.
   - The project leverages efficient algorithms to handle UDP data at rates above 50Hz and logs network interactions with minimal delay.
   - **Tech stack**: C++, Networking, Real-Time Data Processing.

### 2. **MT5 Automated Trading Algorithms & Market Data Analysis**
   - I’m heavily involved in developing trading algorithms for MetaTrader 5 (MT5), focusing on analyzing real-time market data and implementing automated strategies. My work includes data streaming via WebSockets and applying algorithmic techniques to exploit price discrepancies in currency pairs (e.g., GBPUSD).
   - I also perform advanced time-series analysis, utilizing Python to detect potential arbitrage opportunities through ask-bid spread discrepancies.
   - **Tech stack**: MT5, Python, WebSockets, Financial Data Analysis, TradingView.

### 3. **Financial Time-Series Data Processing with Python**
   - My data analysis projects focus on real-time market data, specifically identifying arbitrage opportunities through high-frequency analysis. I’ve developed systems to compare multiple data sources and find price leads during volatile periods, marking significant changes between ask-bid data from different sources.
   - I also work with large datasets for financial modeling, utilizing techniques like moving averages and outlier detection to inform trading decisions.
   - **Tech stack**: Python, Financial Data Processing, High-Frequency Trading, lightweight_charts.

### 4. **Game Development: Real-Time Strategy Game**
   - Drawing inspiration from titles like Age of Empires, I’m building a customizable real-time strategy (RTS) game that includes advanced network synchronization for real-time interactions between multiple players. This game is designed to be highly modular, allowing for customizable map components and AI-driven player behaviors.
   - The challenge lies in maintaining smooth real-time performance, even under heavy network load, which I solve by employing efficient C++ programming techniques.
   - **Tech stack**: C++, Real-Time Strategy, Network Programming.

## 💡 What drives me?

I’m motivated by the challenge of bringing together high-performance systems, real-time data, and cutting-edge financial analysis. Whether it's optimizing network interactions for a game or creating precise trading algorithms to navigate volatile markets, I enjoy pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with technology.


My expertise in C++, Python, and MetaTrader 5 allows me to work across a range of domains, from finance to gaming, all while focusing on real-time performance and data-driven insights. I strive to create impactful projects that deliver both technical excellence and practical value.
